# Collatz Sequence Simulator

This is a simple Python CLI tool that simulates the **Collatz sequence** for any positive integer input. It prints each step of the transformation and counts how many steps it takes to reach 1.

## ðŸ§  What is the Collatz Hypothesis?

The **Collatz conjecture** (also known as the 3n + 1 problem) is an unsolved mathematical puzzle proposed by Lothar Collatz in 1937.

It states:

> Start with any positive integer `n`.  
> If `n` is even â†’ divide it by 2  
> If `n` is odd â†’ multiply by 3 and add 1  
> Repeat the process.  
> Eventually, you will reach the number 1.

Despite its simplicity, no one has proven whether this always holds true for all positive integers.
